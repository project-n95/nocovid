Fix For Redirect Loops on WordPress with CloudFlare's Flexible/Universal SSL.

== Description ==

[Click For Full Implementation Guide](https://icwp.io/6z).

Using CloudFlareÂ® Flexible SSL on WordPress isn't as simple as just turning it on.

This plugin forms an **integral part** to enabling Flexible SSL on WordPress and prevents infinite redirect loops when loading WordPress sites under Cloudflare's Flexible SSL system.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin affect non-SSL traffic? =

No. It only comes into play when Cloudflare is serving HTTPS traffic from your site.

= Should I change my WordPress Site URL to HTTPS? =

No - there is no need.  Use Cloudflare's pages rules to redirect your visitors.  You can then safely turn off SSL whenever you want from within Cloudflare and your WordPress site will still load on HTTP.

= What happens if I disable this plugin AFTER enabling Flexible SSL on Cloudflare? =

Your WordPress site will not load on HTTPS/SSL. You will create an infinite loop loading problem and the only way to solve this is to turn off SSL redirects within Cloudflare.

= Does I need this plugin if I use Cloudflare FULL or Strict SSL? =

No. It is designed only to assist with Flexible SSL.
